Welcome to my personal portfolio, a comprehensive showcase of my projects and skills, complete with detailed information based on my resume. This application is structured around three main components: Services, Actions, and Endpoints.


1. **Services**: This is the backbone of the application, handling a variety of tasks including CRUD operations with the database, interactions with external APIs, AI processes, session management, and more. This concept is similar to the idea of services in a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) or microservices architecture, where each service is a standalone application that performs a specific function.


2. **Actions**: Actions are complex features that combine multiple services. They are divided into two categories: User Actions and System Actions. User Actions are triggered when a user sends a request to the appropriate endpoint. System Actions, on the other hand, are event-driven and activated under certain conditions. This concept is akin to the idea of "business logic" or "use cases" in other architectures, representing the specific actions that the system can perform.


3. **Endpoints**: These are the gateways in the application where user requests are received. Each endpoint is designed to handle specific user requirements, ensuring a smooth and efficient user experience. In web development, endpoints refer to the URLs where the server can receive HTTP requests, acting as an interface between the user and the server.
